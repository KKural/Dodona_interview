## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### File Renaming Strategy:
- All exercises will be renumbered 01-20 to reflect proper pedagogical sequence
- Current folder names will be preserved in parentheses for reference
- Config.json files will be updated with new exercise numbers and names

### Scaffolding Integration:
- Each exercise will include progressive hint systems (conceptual ‚Üí procedural ‚Üí interpretive)
- R code integration increases in complexity from basic syntax to advanced analysis
- Feedback systems adapted to scaffolding level (extensive ‚Üí minimal)

### Quality Assurance:
- Learning objectives clearly mapped to Bloom's levels
- Scaffolding reduction monitored through hint usage metrics
- Student independence tracked across exercise progression
- Criminological context maintained throughout all levels

This reorganization ensures systematic skill development while maintaining strong pedagogical support throughout the learning journey.
