## EXERCISES CHECKED AND CORRECTED:

### Exercise 8: Standard Deviation Calculation
- **Data**: [12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 28, 32, 35]
- **Correct Answer**: 7.61 (population standard deviation)
- **Status**: ✅ CORRECTED
  - Answer.R: Changed from 8.54 to 7.61
  - Student file: Already correct (7.61)
- **Formula**: σ = √(Σ(x-μ)²/n) where n=8
- **Calculation**: Mean=23.375, Variance=57.98438, SD=7.614747 → 7.61

### Exercise 9: Correlation Coefficient Calculation  
- **Data**: X=[2,4,6,8,10,12], Y=[8,6,4,2,1,0]
- **Correct Answer**: -0.989
- **Status**: ✅ CORRECTED
  - Answer.R: Changed from -0.983 to -0.989  
  - Student file: Already correct (-0.989)
- **Formula**: r = Σ(x-x̄)(y-ȳ) / √[Σ(x-x̄)²Σ(y-ȳ)²]
- **Calculation**: Strong negative correlation = -0.9885054 → -0.989

### Exercise 10: Chi-Square Test Analysis
- **Data**: 3×2 contingency table (Education × Crime Type)
  - Laag: [25,15], Midden: [18,22], Hoog: [12,28]
- **Correct Answer**: 8.53
- **Status**: ✅ CORRECTED
  - Answer.R: Changed from 8.54 to 8.53
  - Student file: Changed from 8.54 to 8.53
- **Formula**: χ² = Σ(O-E)²/E
- **Calculation**: χ² = 8.525874 → 8.53

### Exercise 13: t-Test Calculation
- **Data**: Group1=[15,18,22,19,21,17], Group2=[12,10,14,11,9,13]  
- **Correct Answer**: 5.51
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED CORRECT
  - Answer.R: Already correct (5.51)
  - Student file: Already correct (5.51)
- **Formula**: t = (x̄₁-x̄₂)/SE_pooled
- **Calculation**: t = (18.67-11.5)/1.301 = 5.51

### Exercise 14: Confidence Interval Construction
- **Data**: [24,28,32,26,30,22,35,29,27]
- **Correct Answer**: "25.05,31.17" 
- **Status**: ✅ CORRECTED
  - Answer.R: Changed from "24.65,31.35" to "25.05,31.17"
  - Student file: Already correct ("25.05,31.17")
- **Formula**: CI = x̄ ± t×SE where t₀.₀₂₅,₈ = 2.306
- **Calculation**: 28.11 ± 2.306×1.33 = [25.05, 31.17]

### Exercise 15: Effect Size Calculation (Cohen's d)
- **Data**: Group1(n=25): μ=45,σ=12; Group2(n=25): μ=38,σ=10
- **Correct Answer**: 0.63
- **Status**: ✅ CORRECTED  
  - Answer.R: Changed from 0.64 to 0.63
  - Student file: Already correct (0.63)
- **Formula**: d = (x̄₁-x̄₂)/s_pooled
- **Calculation**: d = (45-38)/11.05 = 0.63

## EXERCISES 1-7: Basic Statistics
**Status**: ✅ ALL VERIFIED CORRECT
- All use proper R comment syntax (#)
- All have correct conceptual answers
- All Answer.R files are accurate

## EXERCISES 11-12, 16-20: Advanced Topics
**Status**: ⚠️ NOT FULLY VERIFIED
- These exercises involve interpretation and qualitative answers
- Need individual verification of Answer.R logic
- Student files may need solutions added

## MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION METHODS USED:
1. R built-in statistical functions (cor, sd, mean, etc.)
2. Manual step-by-step calculations
3. Cross-verification with standard statistical formulas
4. Comparison with expected theoretical results

## KEY ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED:
1. **Wrong expected values**: Several Answer.R files had incorrect expected answers
2. **Rounding discrepancies**: Minor differences due to rounding methods
3. **Formula inconsistencies**: Some used sample vs population formulas incorrectly
4. **Parsing errors**: trim() vs trimws() function issues (already fixed)

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH
All mathematical calculations have been verified using multiple methods and R's built-in statistical functions. The corrected answers are mathematically accurate and should work properly in the Dodona submission system.
